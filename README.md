# SOLID-Principles-In-TypeScript

The SOLID principles are five design principles in object-oriented programming that help create clean, maintainable, and scalable code. These principles ensure that your software is easy to understand, extend, and modify.

---

## **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
A class or module should have only one responsibility, meaning it should have only one reason to change.  
> **Why?** This makes code easier to maintain and reduces complexity.

---

## **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
> **Why?** You can add new functionality without altering existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

---  

## **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.  
> **Why?** This ensures that derived classes extend functionality without breaking the parent class.

---

## **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.  
> **Why?** This avoids bloated interfaces and ensures that classes implement only what they need.

---

## **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.  
> **Why?** This reduces coupling and makes your system more flexible to changes.

---

## Benefits of SOLID Principles
- Promotes better code organization and readability.
- Enhances scalability and maintainability.
- Reduces the risk of introducing bugs when adding or modifying features.

By following SOLID principles, you can build robust software systems that are easier to understand, test, and extend over time.
